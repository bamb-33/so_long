# so long
This project is a very small 2D game.
Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites,
and some other very basic gameplay elements.
## x-windows
the whole x-windows thing is built around tcp/ip networks with the idea that a graphical application would run on a server and the clints which are the programs and applictaions on the computer will request from that user if they wanna draw something in the screen.

- x-windows system is a windowing graphical system that let you use GUI for your computer's OS and its mostly used in linux.
- windowing system is a GUI that that allows you to open multiple windows at once and overlap them and so many stuff not like the old system that had so many disadvantages. (https://www.techopedia.com/topic/87/artificial-intelligence)
- graphics system is the software and the hardware that is responsable for rendering and displying the graphics overall.
- the client/server model is basically a way to not waste the ressources of your own computer, everything.
is gonne be stored in a server and whenver you need a service you re just gonne make a request to the server and it will send it to you without consuming any of your cumputer's ressources.  (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/client-server-model/)

#### in the compilation proccess we include two frameworks OpenGl AppKit
you can see a framework as a template for the work you re trynna do, it has the foundation and the basics and everything you ll need to build whatever you want so you won't have to start from scratch. (https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-framework/)

the difference between a library and a framework is that you controle when you can use functions from that library it means you're in controle but when it cames to a framework just like what is said in the deffinition its a template so you gotta follow what is said in that template and do it so it means it controls how the work is gonna be done.
